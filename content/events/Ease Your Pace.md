### Introduction:

*“Speaking is a skill and writing is an art. Both are required if you want to be a skilled artist”*

Writing is one of the integral parts in effective communication. Irrespective of the discipline and stream, it is one of the crucial skills an engineer needs to develop. We know that it is often overwhelming and difficult to make a choice from where to start off your writing practice. We are here to give you some ideas and guide you to start on with your writing.

### Description :

Writing Prompts will unleash the creative spirit in you, not to mention the writing skills you can refine with this basic activity.

Describing a Scene is a simple yet beneficial writing that helps you convey complicated information in a more appealing way. Descriptive writing will help develop the skill of presenting one’s ideas effectively which helps influence decisions in strategic situations. The constraint on the number of words will give you the correct guidance for informal and formal writing. 

Paradoxes challenge our thinking and open a whole new perspective to solving a problem. This is a really important aspect that is helpful in engineering where we work on solving real-world problems.
