#### Summary:
As part of Republic Day Celebrations, Debate Club and LAC will be hosting our annual exposition/public-speaking event Standpoint; We hope to see active participation from your side!

****

#### Rules:

1. The topic chosen must be one of national importance. Try to choose specific topics that captivate your audience's attention, rather than generic ones. For instance, talking about any particular instance/person of the Kargil war would be better than talking in general about the Indian Army.

2. Participants can speak for a max. of five minutes

3. Use of PowerPoint presentation/keynote is allowed. A maximum of 5 slides can be used.

*The Preliminary Rounds are scheduled this weekend (Saturday or Sunday). The final timings will be announced shortly.*
