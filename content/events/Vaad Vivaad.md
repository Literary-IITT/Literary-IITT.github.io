#### Event Format:
The event might be split into multiple rounds or a single round depending on the number of participants. The general rules are as follows: 

- This will be a team event with a team size of two members. 
- If a large number of participants appear., we may have a fun screening round where each participant  has to individually speak on a given topic. 
- A fixed number of teams will be selected for the final round based on the scores of the previous round. 
- The final round will be a knockout-style debate round. The teams will be seeded based on their scores and matched up in knockout debates. 
- Each team will have two speakers with the general format being as follows: 

  + Team 1 Speaker 1: (Govt Side/ For) --- 4 minutes   
  + Team 2 Speaker 1: (Opposition Side/ Against) -- 4 minutes 
  + Team 1 Speaker 2: (Govt Side/ For) -- 4 minutes 
  + Team 2 Speaker 2: (Opposition Side/ Against) -- 4 minutes 

- Speaker 1 from each team presents their arguments. Speaker 2 from each team can add more points and can spend time countering the other side. If you are a fan of fancy terms Google “Oxford Format for Debating”. 

- IMPORTANT NOTE: The format of these events is not fixed rigidly. We will be introducing fun tweaks and twists (cross questoning, open debates and others) in these formats if needed. We will however ensure that no team will have an unfair advantage as far as the events and preparation time goes. The topics will be released on spot. 

- Time penalties may apply for exceeding time limits.
